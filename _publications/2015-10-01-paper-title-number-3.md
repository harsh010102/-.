Dramatic price changes in pharmaceutical equities reflect unexpected scientific information gained throughout the pharmaceutical R&D process, such as clinical trial results, recalls and withdrawals, and the approval of new treatments. During the Covid19 shutdown, major pharmaceutical firms were studying and producing vaccinations, pills, and other medicines to combat the coronavirus outbreak. This activity has a substantial impact on the global and Indian markets. Stock price prediction is an important issue in finance and economics that has piqued the interest of scholars throughout the years in developing better predictive algorithms. To evaluate Sun Pharma Ltd. data, we employed machine learning techniques such as K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Linear Regression, and Fbprophet during the time frame 2016 to 2020. It is the second-largest Indian pharmaceutical firm in terms of stock volume. Statistical modeling algorithm Fbprophet outperforms standard regressing algorithms like K-nearest neighbor and Linear regression on time series data.
