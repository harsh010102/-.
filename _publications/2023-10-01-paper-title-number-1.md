Globally, the use of cryptocurrencies to purchase goods and services has been rising. They rely on a secure distributed ledger data structure; mining is an integral part of such systems. The rise of cryptocurrencies’ value on the market and the growing popularity around the world open several challenges and concerns for business and industrial economics. Cryptocurrencies have been triggered by the substantial changes in their prices, claims that the market for cryptocurrencies is a bubble without any fundamental value and also concerns about evasion of regulatory and legal oversight. Machine learning is part of artificial intelligence that can make future forecastings based on previous experience. In this paper, methods have been proposed to construct machine learning algorithm-based models such as linear regression, K-nearest neighbour(KNN), and also statistical models like Auto-ARIMA and Facebook’s Prophet (Fbprophet). This paper presents a comparative performance of machine learning and statistical modelling algorithms for cryptocurrency forecasting.
