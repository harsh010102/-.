In recent years, the idea of autonomous vehicles is on pace as some automobile companies have decided to develop their autonomous cars. Autonomous mobile robots (AMR) are currently being used in a variety of intra-logistics operations, such as warehousing, terminals, manufacturing, hospitals, and cross-docks. Their advanced control software and hardware allow autonomous operations in dynamic environments. In this paper, we have implemented a differential drive robot equipped with a depth camera and an RP LIDAR. This robot is capable of autonomous navigation through the warehouse environment by processing the data obtained through the sensors in real time. It can navigate to a particular shelf and then count the no. of cartons present on the shelf and compare it with previous data to give us an idea about the present inventory. It uses deep learning-based object detection models for the detection of cardboard boxes on a shelf.
