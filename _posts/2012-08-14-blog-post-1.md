Summer 2022 was one of the most amazing times, I got an amazing opportunity to visit the Canadian Centre for Climate Change and Adaptation as a Research Intern via the prestigious MITACS Globalink Research Internship program. Through this article, Iâ€™d like to share my experience, vibe, and door of opportunities that one can get via MITACS GRI and kickstart their careers with a dose of research excitement!

The MITACS Globalink Research Internship (MITACS GRI) is a highly competitive program open to international undergraduate students from various countries. It offers a unique opportunity to participate in research projects under the guidance of faculty members at Canadian academic institutions.Notably, this program extends financial support for travel from one's home country to Canada, covers research-related expenses, and facilitates a 12-week stay in Canada during the internship period.

I am Harsh Parikh and Iâ€™m currently a final year undergrad student pursuing my B.Tech from Nirma University, Ahmedabad-India.I started my journey in Canada from India  a little excited and nervous since it was my first international journey. I had to take a flight from Ahmedabad to Doha to MontrÃ©al to Charlottetown (sounds very tedious and I was exhausted as hell I still remember 13hr layover in MontrÃ©al).My research interests lie mainly in the fields of Applied Machine Learning , with a particular focus on Climate Modelling. I find this field incredibly fascinating, and Iâ€™m always eager to learn more about it and explore new applications.

During my Internship I quickly grasped new operating procedures and principles realted to on-feild research of Enviromental science and Precision agriculture domain. Taking on an independent role, I successfully led a team in the installation of nitrogen-collecting tubes. Following this, I employed Temperature and Moisture sensors with data readers to monitor and collect overall health of the field.

This hands-on experience not only developed my understanding of field research but also allowed me to actively contribute to the implementation and calibration of advanced technologies in environmental monitoring like [LI-COR7810](https://www.licor.com/env/products/trace-gas/LI-7810) and [Soil-flux chambers systems](https://www.licor.com/env/products/soil-flux/).

My MITACS project focused on hydrology of the Province.Enviroment Canada provided watershed data of all three counties of Prince Edward Island which included crucial informtion such as flow rate, precipitation levels, average snowfall, temperature, and more. My task was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the island's freshwater depletion, identify potential risk factors, and explore possible mitigation strategies. The region relies primarily on rainfall and snowfall for its freshwater supply. Situated in the northern Atlantic Ocean, the Island remains susceptible to storms and hurricanes that disrupt ocean tides, causing substantial damage to groundwater levels.

I showcased my model and presented the results in form of a Poster at the annual conference of Canadian Society of Bioengineering. Being part of the Organizing commitee added an extra layer of engagement to my participation. Such, involvement allowed me to not only contribute as a scholar but also actively contribute to the seamless execution of the event itself. During which I learned a lot about conference management and best practices.

In the concluding phase of my internship, I collaborated with the Government of Prince Edward Island to develop a novel benchmark for Coastal Erosion patterns.My fieldwork involved gathering peg-line measurements spanning approximately 50 kilometers along the northern coast of Prince Edward Island. This endevour was a highlight of internship offering me the incredible experience of spending quality time cruising along the sea. Upon returning to the lab, I integrated peg-line measurements with Sentinel-2 raster files, fusing real-world observations with geo-spatial data.

 Living independently in Canada for three months was truly a life-changing experience for me. This period instilled in me a  sense of responsibility and self-reliance, revealing a mature aspect of my personality that was previously unknown to me. It was like a sneak peek into what my life could be like if I decided to pursue Master's degree abroad as a International student.I left Canada not only with a wealth of research experience but also with a newfound confidence in my abilities and a network of mentors and friends that I know will stay with me for life.
