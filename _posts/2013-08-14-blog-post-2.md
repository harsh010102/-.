During the early fall of 2023, from July to October, I had the privilege of serving as a Research Fellow in Dr. Laurent Bindschaedler's Data System research group at Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in SaarbrÃ¼cken, Germany. It was an immersive and enlightening experience, involving work on cutting-edge research challenges alongside some of the most distinguished researchers and PhD students, and also making some amazing friends from across the globe. In this blog , I will revisit the most memorable aspects of this extraordinary journey.
